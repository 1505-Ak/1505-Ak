# Mac File Workflow Builder

A small front-end project that turns your Finder pain points into a recommended macOS tooling stack.

## What it does

- Lets you choose between:
  - **Replacing Finder** with power-user alternatives.
  - **Keeping Finder** but adding automation and cleanup utilities.
- Scores tools based on your preferences for:
  - keyboard-driven workflow,
  - automation depth,
  - cloud/multi-device usage,
  - lightweight utility bias.
- Recommends a top-3 setup using projects like Commander One, Marta, Spacedrive, Hazel, TagSpaces, Rectangle, PearCleaner, and Alfred.

## Run locally

Because this is a static project, you can open `index.html` directly or run a simple server:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

Then visit `http://localhost:8000`.
